The "FlutterFuse" extension is a Visual Studio Code extension for working with Flutter projects. 

If you have been working with Flutter for a while, you know that sometimes it can get very boring and repetitive to fix imports of the .dart files, specially if you are using the "Quick Fix" option manually.

Of course there are multiple extensions available and the VS Code's `Fix All` and `Organize Imports` didn't work for me so I thought why not create a silly extension for that; and I did that.


## Features

- Fix imports in the current .dart file
This extension will automatically import the relevant files required for the current .dart file. Also after importing, it'll run the `Fix All` option to try to fix if duplicate imports are there. (Like cupertino and material). But this is not fully tested.


## Demo

## Known Issues

- If the imports are not resolved within 10 seconds, you'll have to run the `FlutterFuse: Fix Imports` command again.
- If errors that are not "Quick Fix" able exists, the importing process will run for 10 seconds and then timeout.
## Roadmap

- Give an option to fix imports in whole project instead of just the currently opened .dart file
